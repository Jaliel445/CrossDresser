Dressing as a lady and looking good while doing it.

  This is my directions on how to dress as a woman.
Dressing as a woman is a lifestyle. It takes time
every morning to get ready for the day, so get up
early.
   To start, shave any hair that is going to show
out of your outfit, such as your face, arms, legs
and chest. After this is finished, you're ready to
go to the next step.
    Now, before you put on your clothes, put on your
makeup. Remember to choose colors that enhance your
facial features, not cover them.
    Now you're ready for clothes. First put on your
panties and hose. Then your bra. Next is your skirt
or dress, then shoes. And, finally, the wig.
    Remember, buy clothing that compliments you, not
hide you. The same goes for the wig. Pick a style
and color that makes you stand out in a crowd. Now,
go out and have a good, LadyLike day.

    Hello. It's me again. Now have you paid attention
to the news. People that are LGBQ are not aloud in the same
classroom as the other kids. What a screwed up mess is that.
    When our government decides on a topic like this, 
it isn't Democracy any more, it's almost Socialism.
But, it's not all the government's fault. It's basically
the fault of those people who are HOMOPHOBES. 
       WHAT A BUNCH OF BUTTHOLES THEY ARE!!!!

    Hope you have a LadyLike day!!
